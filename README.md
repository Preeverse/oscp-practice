## Quick overview
This repository contains hands-on labs, CTF writeups, and automation artifacts that demonstrate skills in SIEM (Splunk), vulnerability scanning (Nessus, ZAP), network and web penetration testing, and incident response. These projects map directly to the experience listed on my resume and were completed as part of CompTIA lab tracks and HTB challenges.

**Recruiter note:** For a quick review, read the `README` files in the folders below. Key artifacts: Splunk queries, Nmap/Nessus outputs, PowerShell/Bash scripts, and full HTB writeups.

## Highlighted project â€” HTB Holmes CTF (2025)
Short summary: Completed CTF with forensic challenges, reverse engineering, and detection tasks.  
Key actions:
- Forensics: image analysis, timeline reconstruction.
- Reverse engineering: simple scripts reversed to reveal attacker logic.
- Detection: correlated IoCs and mapped activity to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.
