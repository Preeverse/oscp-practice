#  Issue with Enable Password Command
While configuring switches in a network, I noticed something important about using the `enable password` option.

It turns out that `enable password` stores the password in **clear text** — which means anyone viewing the switch configuration (via `show running-config`) can see it.

##  Example Scenario
If your configuration files are backed up to a server, anyone with access to that server could read your switch password straight from the backup.

This might seem basic, but it *might still happen* in some environments — a small reminder that can prevent a big headache later.

##  Safer Approach
- Use `enable secret` instead of `enable password`.
- If you *must* use `enable password`, make sure to encrypt it:
  ```bash
  service password-encryption
