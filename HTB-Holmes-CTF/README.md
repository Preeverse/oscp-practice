## Overview

I participated as part of a team in the **HTB Holmes CTF (2025)**, a Capture the Flag event focused on real-world cyber investigation and threat analysis.  
I personally completed two challenges â€” **The Card** and **The Enduring Echo** â€” which are documented in this repository.

These scenarios gave me strong hands-on experience with:

- Log analysis and event correlation  
- Web and disk forensics  
- Connecting intelligence across platforms like **honeypots**, **SIEM**, and **forensic tools**

Each challenge sharpened my understanding of how to trace attacks, extract indicators, and link attacker behavior across multiple stages.

All artifacts have been sanitized and exported from lab environments. I'm happy to walk through any part of the investigation upon request.
